CH4: Celsius to Fahrenheit Temperature Converter
Write a program that converts Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit temperatures. The formula is as follows:

                                        F=  9/5*C+32

The program should ask the user to enter a temperature in Celsius, then display the temperature converted to Fahrenheit.
