## CH10: Restaurant Selector
You have a group of friends coming to visit for your high school reunion, and you want to take them out to eat at a local restaurant. You aren’t sure if any of them have dietary restrictions, but your restaurant choices are as follows:

-   Joe’s Gourmet Burgers—Vegetarian: No, Vegan: No, Gluten-Free: No
-   Main Street Pizza Company—Vegetarian: Yes, Vegan: No, Gluten-Free: Yes
-   Corner Café—Vegetarian: Yes, Vegan: Yes, Gluten-Free: Yes
-   Mama’s Fine Italian—Vegetarian: Yes, Vegan: No, Gluten-Free: No
-   The Chef’s Kitchen—Vegetarian: Yes, Vegan: Yes, Gluten-Free: Yes

Write a program that asks whether any members of your party are vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free, to which then displays only the restaurants to which you may take the group.

Here is another example of the program’s output:
```
>>> Is anyone in your party a vegetarian? yes 
>>> Is anyone in your party a vegan? yes 
>>> Is anyone in your party gluten-free? yes 

```
Here are your restaurant choices:
