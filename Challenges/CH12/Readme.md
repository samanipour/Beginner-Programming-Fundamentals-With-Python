### CH12: Population
Write a program that predicts the approximate size of a population of organisms. The application should use text boxes to allow the user to enter the starting number of organisms, the average daily population increase (as a percentage), and the number of days the organisms will be left to multiply. 

For example, assume the user enters the following values:

- Starting number of organisms: 2
- Average daily increase: 30%
- Number of days to multiply: 10

The program should display the following table of data:
```
Day 		Approximate Population
1 			2
2 			2.6
3 			3.38
4 			4.394
5 			5.7122
6 			7.42586
7 			9.653619
8 			12.5497
9 			16.31462
10 			21.209
```
