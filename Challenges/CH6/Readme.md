### CH6: Stock Transaction Program
Last month, Joe purchased some stock in Acme Software, Inc. Here are the details of the purchase:

-	The number of shares that Joe purchased was 2,000.
-	When Joe purchased the stock, he paid $40.00 per share.
-	Joe paid his stockbroker a commission that amounted to 3 percent of the amount he paid for the stock.

Two weeks later, Joe sold the stock. Here are the details of the sale:
-	The number of shares that Joe sold was 2,000.
-	He sold the stock for $42.75 per share.
-	He paid his stockbroker another commission that amounted to 3 percent of the amount he received for the stock.

Write a program that displays the following information:
-	The amount of money Joe paid for the stock.
-	The amount of commission Joe paid his broker when he bought the stock.
-	The amount for which Joe sold the stock.
-	The amount of commission Joe paid his broker when he sold the stock.
-	Display the amount of money that Joe had left when he sold the stock and paid his broker (both times). If this amount is positive, then Joe made a profit. If the amount is negative, then Joe lost money.
